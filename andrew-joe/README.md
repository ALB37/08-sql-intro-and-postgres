# Code 301 Lab 07 nodejs-npm-express

**Andrew Bloom, Jeff Kusowski**
**Version 1.0.6**

## Overview
1. We forked the lab 07 repo for this lab into Andrew's GitHub account. Andrew created a new branch and we started out with Jeff navigating and Andrew driving. When we switched roles during pair programming, Jeff fetched the working branch and pulled down the changes.
2. We first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Next we worked on going through each of the todo and comment sections and completing the todo's and commenting as necessary.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and open up the index.html file in your browser.

## Architecture
The focus of this lab was writing code in server.js to make a server.  We used ExpressJS to simplify this process.

## Change Log

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Dustin Mundy. Based off of the starter code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. Using jQuery, Handlebars, highlighting.js, marked.js, and ExpressJS libraries.
